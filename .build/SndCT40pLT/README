NAME
    Alien::Bit - Find or install the Bit library

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Installs the Bit library, used to manipulate bitsets and their packed
    containers

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides the librry Bit so that it can be used by
    other Perl distributions that are on CPAN. It will download Bit from
    Github and will build the (static and dynamic) versions of the library
    for use by other Perl modules.

SEE ALSO
    Bit <https://github.com/chrisarg/Bit>
        Bit is a high-performance, uncompressed bitset implementation in C,
        optimized for modern architectures. The library provides an
        efficient way to create, manipulate, and query bitsets with a focus
        on performance and memory alignment. The API and the interface is
        largely based on David Hanson's Bit_T library discussed in Chapter
        13 of "C Interfaces and Implementations", Addison-Wesley ISBN
        0-201-49841-3 extended to incorporate additional operations (such as
        counts on unions/differences/intersections of sets), fast population
        counts using the libpocnt library and GPU operations for packed
        containers of (collections) of Bit(sets).

    libpopcnt <https://github.com/kimwalisch/libpopcnt>
        libpopcnt.h is a header-only C/C++ library for counting the number
        of 1 bits (bit population count) in an array as quickly as possible
        using specialized CPU instructions i.e. POPCNT, AVX2, AVX512, NEON,
        SVE. libpopcnt.h has been tested successfully using the GCC, Clang
        and MSVC compilers.
